                            Building an NHL team is a meticulous task. In a league where even the best
                            players are
                            only on
                            the
                            ice for 20 minutes at a time and draft picks are often mere teenagers
                            nowhere close to
                            making an
                            impact on the team that drafted them, the best rosters are built by multiple
                            moves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some moves get teams their stars, the foundational building blocks upon
                            which everything
                            and
                            everyone else is shaped. Others bring in supporting casts that slot in
                            around the lineup
                            and
                            form
                            the connective tissue of a team.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “Teams that win, win because they have star players and because they
                            surrounded them
                            with
                            talent,”
                            Dom Luszczyszyn, National NHL reporter for The Athletic, said in 2016 in a
                            piece for The
                            Hockey
                            News. “While the top three guys are vital to success, most team cores
                            contain a couple
                            more
                            players
                            and each piece is important to long-term success.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Teams have three main ways of acquiring players: they can draft them, sign
                            them as free
                            agents,
                            or
                            trade for them. There are exceptions — players can be claimed off waivers or
                            signed as
                            restricted
                            free agents. There are also indirect acquisitions where a team trades for a
                            draft pick
                            and uses
                            it
                            on a player.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most of the time, NHL teams play with four forward lines of three players
                            each — one
                            center
                            flanked
                            by two wings. They’ll also add three defensive pairings of two defenders and
                            two
                            goalies, a
                            starter
                            and a backup.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where did the best teams get those 20 players from? How many were drafted,
                            traded for,
                            or
                            signed?
                            What were common threads between the best teams?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The top five teams at the end of this years’ regular season were the Florida
                            Panthers,
                            the
                            Colorado
                            Avalanche, the Carolina Hurricanes, the Toronto Maple Leafs, and the
                            Minnesota Wild.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Across those five teams, 38 players were acquired via trade, 32 via the
                            draft, and 30
                            via
                            signings
                            or waiver claims.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Among those teams, Colorado traded for the most players with 10. Carolina
                            and Minnesota
                            drafted
                            the
                            most players with seven each. Carolina and Toronto tied for the most players
                            signed or
                            claimed
                            on
                            waivers with seven each.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most of the teams’ best players came via high draft picks. Three of the
                            teams boast at
                            least
                            three
                            players taken in the top five of the draft, including No. 1 overall picks
                            Auston
                            Mathews, Nathan
                            Mackinnon, and Aaron Ekblad.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The two teams that didn’t feature multiple top-five draft picks, Carolina
                            and Minnesota,
                            still
                            largely assembled their core in the draft.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Hurricanes drafted Sebastian Aho at No. 35 in 2015, Andrei Svechnikov at
                            No. 2 in
                            2018 and
                            Jaccob Slavin at No. 120 in 2012.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Wild drafted Kirill Kaprizov No. 135 in 2015 and Joel Eriksson Ek No. 20
                            in 2015.
                            The major
                            exception comes with Minnesota’s star defenseman, Jared Spurgeon, who was
                            drafted by the
                            Islanders
                            but failed to sign a contract with them and signed as a free agent with the
                            Wild in
                            2010.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That draft-heavy approach only applied to skaters. No team drafted its
                            goalie, as each
                            of the
                            top-five team’s presumptive starter began their career somewhere else.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “[Goaltending is] actually one of the last things you really need to worry
                            about for
                            your teams’
                            core,” Luszczyszyn wrote. “You absolutely don’t want a guy that’ll lose
                            games, but … he
                            doesn’t
                            have
                            to be elite, just good enough not to blow it. Goaltending is obviously
                            important, and it
                            doesn’t
                            hurt to have an elite guy, but you can win without one.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another key aspect for all these teams is how much they spend. In a league
                            with a hard
                            salary
                            cap
                            like the NHL, it’s imperative that teams spend as close to the upper limit
                            as possible.
                            All of
                            the
                            top-five teams finished with under $2 million dollars in cap space.
                            Minnesota, the
                            lowest-ranked
                            squad of the five, was the only team with above $200,000 in cap space.
