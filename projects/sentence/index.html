    <p>A sentence diagram is a pictorial representation of the grammatical structure of a sentence. The term "sentence
        diagram" is used more when teaching written language, where sentences are diagrammed. The model shows the
        relations between words and the nature of sentence structure and can be used as a tool to help recognize which
        potential sentences are actual sentences.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Most methods of diagramming in pedagogy are based on the work of Alonzo Reed and Brainerd Kellogg. Some teachers
        continue to use the Reedâ€“Kellogg system in teaching grammar,[citation needed] but others have discouraged it in
        favor of more modern tree diagrams.</p>
    <h2>Reed-Kellog System</h2>
    <p>Simple sentences in the Reed-Kellogg system are diagrammed according to these forms:</p>

    <p>The diagram of a simple sentence begins with a horizontal line called the base. The subject is written on the
        left, the predicate on the right, separated by a vertical bar which extends through the base. The predicate must
        contain a verb, and the verb either requires other sentence elements to complete the predicate, permits them to
        do so, or precludes them from doing so. The verb and its object, when present, are separated by a line that ends
        at the baseline. If the object is a direct object, the line is vertical. If the object is a predicate noun or
        adjective, the line looks like a backslash, \, sloping toward the subject.</p>
