            <p>
                The Wire is an American crime drama television series created and primarily written by author and former
                police reporter David Simon. The series was broadcast by the cable network HBO in the United States. The
                Wire premiered on June 2, 2002, and ended on March 9, 2008, comprising 60 episodes over five
                seasons. The idea for the show started out as a police drama loosely based on the experiences of his
                writing partner Ed Burns, a former homicide detective and public school teacher.

            <!--season breakdown-->
            <h3>
                Season 1
            </h3>
            <p>
                The first season introduces two major groups of characters: the Baltimore Police Department and a drug
                dealing organization run by the Barksdale family. The season follows the police investigation of the
                latter over its 13 episodes.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Season 2
            </h3>
            <p>
                The second season, along with its ongoing examination of the drug problem and its effect on the urban
                poor, examines the plight of the blue-collar urban working class as exemplified by dockworkers in the
                city port, as some of them get caught up in smuggling drugs and other contraband inside the shipping
                containers that pass through their port. In a season-long subplot, the Barksdale organization continues
                its drug trafficking despite Avon's imprisonment, with Stringer Bell assuming greater power.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Season 3
            </h3>
            <p>
                In the third season, the focus returns to the street and the Barksdale organization. The scope is
                expanded to include the city's political scene. A new subplot is introduced to explore the potential
                positive effects of de facto "legalizing" the illegal drug trade, and incidentally prostitution, within
                the limited boundaries of a few uninhabited city blocks—referred to as Hamsterdam. The posited benefits,
                as in Amsterdam and other European cities, are reduced street crime city-wide and increased outreach of
                health and social services to vulnerable people. These are continuations of stories hinted at earlier.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Season 4
            </h3>
            <p>
                The fourth season concentrates on the school system and the mayoral race. It takes a closer look at
                Marlo Stanfield's drug gang, which has grown to control most of western Baltimore's trafficking, and
                Dukie, Randy, Michael, and Namond – four boys from West Baltimore – as they enter the eighth grade.
                Prez has begun a new career as a mathematics teacher at the same school. The cold-blooded Marlo has come
                to dominate the streets of the west side, using murder and intimidation to make up for his weak-quality
                drugs and lack of business acumen. His enforcers Chris Partlow and Snoop conceal their numerous victims
                in abandoned and boarded-up row houses where the bodies will not be readily discovered. The
                disappearances of so many known criminals come to mystify both the major crimes unit
                investigating Marlo and the homicide unit assigned to solve the presumed murders. Marlo coerces Bodie
                into working under him.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Season 5
            </h3>
            <p>
                The fifth season focuses on the media and media consumption. The show features a fictional depiction of
                the newspaper The Baltimore Sun, and in fact elements of the plot are ripped-from-the-headlines events
                (such as the Jayson Blair New York Times scandal) and people at the Sun. The season, according to David
                Simon, deals with "what stories get told and what don't and why it is that things stay the same." Issues
                such as the quest for profit, the decrease in the number of reporters, and the end of aspiration for
                news quality would all be addressed, alongside the theme of homelessness. John Carroll of The Baltimore
                Sun was the model for the "craven, prize
                hungry" editor of the fictional newspaper.
